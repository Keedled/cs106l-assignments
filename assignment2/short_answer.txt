Marriage Pact
-------------

Q1. It is your choice to use either an ordered or unordered set. In a few sentences, what are some of the tradeoffs between the two? Additionally, please give an example (that has not been shown in lecture) of a valid hash function that could be used to hash student names for an unordered set.
A1. "建议是使用标准的库，不然自己实现总会感觉碰撞几率会非常大。"

Q2. Note that we are saving pointers to names in the queue, not names themselves. Why might this be desired in this problem? What happens if the original set where the names are stored goes out of scope and the pointers are referenced?
A2. 针存储在队列中而不是直接存储对象本身,节省内存,共享数据,简化数据结构;访问悬空指针会导致 未定义行为，比如程序崩溃或数据错误。
